# Dataset configuration — 13-class segmentation with Pfirrmann grading
#
# Pfirrmann Grading Reference:
#   Grade 1 — Normal disc, homogeneous, bright white
#   Grade 2 — Inhomogeneous with horizontal band, white, normal height
#   Grade 3 — Inhomogeneous, gray, normal to slightly decreased height
#   Grade 4 — Inhomogeneous, gray to black, moderately decreased height
#   Grade 5 — Inhomogeneous, black, collapsed disc space
#
# Disc Levels Graded:
#   D5 — L5-S1 (lumbosacral junction)
#   D4 — L4-L5
#   D3 — L3-L4
